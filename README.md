# Övning 8 — Bootstrap Kaffeparty

A simple, responsive static website built with Bootstrap for a fictional coffee company. It includes product listings and event info, an about page, and a home page with images and basic styling.

## Project Structure

```
Ovning8_Bootstrap_kaffeparty/
├─ index.html        # Home page
├─ products.html     # Product listing
├─ about.html        # About page
├─ custom.css        # Custom styles overriding Bootstrap
├─ assets/           # Images and media
└─ Ovning8_Bootstrap_kaffeparty.code-workspace
```

## Getting Started

You can open the pages directly in your browser by double-clicking `index.html`. For a nicer developer experience, run a lightweight static server:

## Custom Styling

- All custom styles live in `custom.css`.
- Use Bootstrap utility classes for layout and spacing; keep custom CSS minimal.
- If you change image paths or add new assets, place them under `assets/` and update HTML references accordingly.

## Deployment

- Website is deployed to azure.
